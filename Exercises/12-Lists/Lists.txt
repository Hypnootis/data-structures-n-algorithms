1. Implement a singly-linked list (only head reference). The list can contain any type of items; use generic type T for the list item. Create a driver class to test your solution. 

2. Implement a refined version of a singly-linked list with head and tail references. The list can contain any type of items; use generic type T for the list item. Create a driver class to test your solution. 

3. (Additional exercise, submission not required) Implement a doubly-linked list where each node contains a reference to the previous and next node in the list. 

The previous pointer of the first node and the next pointer of the last node point to null. The list can contain any type of items; use generic type T for the list item. Create a driver class to test your solution.
